The goal of ln.knn.regression is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of ln.knn.regression from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("DSCI-310/dsci-310-group-09-pkg")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(ln.knn.regression)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.


Another useful function in this package is `scatter_plot()`. It takes in the variables `var1`,`var2`, the labels of the x-axis `xlab` and for the y-axis `ylab`, a title of the scatter plot `title`, and `text_size` to specify the size of text of the labels and title. 

```{r}
library(ln.knn.regression)
(data <- mtcars)
(var1 <- mpg)
(var2 <- hp)
(xlab <- "Miles Per Gallon (mpg)")
(ylab <- "Horsepower (hp)")
(title <- "Scatterplot of MPG vs HP")
(text_size <- 10)
scatter_plot(data,var1,var2,xlab,ylab,title,text_size)
```

The useful function allows you to generate a simple scatter plot with the essential parameters to aid the visualization of your analysis. It makes sure that each parameter is the right type whether it is a data frame, numeric value, or string and produces an error if one does not have the right type of input.
