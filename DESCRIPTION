Description: This package contains functions that will help when you are building either a linear or KNN 
             regression model. You will be able to perform exploratory data analysis by creating summary tables and 
             visualizations like bar graph, histograms, and scatterplots. Additionally, you will be able to check the   
             accuracy of your regression model to assess how good of a model it is.
